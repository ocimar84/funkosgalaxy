### Cheatsheets and Auto Generation Tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables.

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [markdown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
Copy your readme to http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

**Granular Goals Example**
> **Customers**
> Customers of What2do2day are children ages 12-18 who have a bit of freedom to move around unsupervised but a short range of mobility, approximately 5 miles from home.
>
**Customer Goals:**
> - Bring up the site and look for an inexpensive event to attend close to home
> - Look at places to see how they rank without having to read much
> - Quickly find activities that interest them without having to type much
> - Read reviews about places that interest them
> - See events related to places that interest them
> - Easily know where an event they are interested in is located
> - Join an event of interest
> - See how many others are interested in an event
> - Receive notification about an event they've joined
> - Receive updates about events they've joined
>
> **Place Owners**
> Owners of Places would ideally have a different set of user permissions and the Update and Contribute sections of navigation would be under a strict workflow, but in the initial phase, I wanted to show off the ability to add, update and delete items from the website's view,so it's not hidden behind permissions or workflow at this point. Place owners are those that have a business or an organization that hosts free events within a community. Examples are a group that wants to play pickup soccer or a bicycle shop that leads group rides once a month.
>
> **Funko Stores Owner Goals**
>
> - I want my Funko store to be prominently showcased on the website to attract more customers and increase footfall.

> - I want to manage and update the events hosted by my store, keeping enthusiasts informed about upcoming activities.
> - I want to feature special Funko-related events and promotions associated with my store to engage with collectors.

The features in the table below have been taken from the user stories above. Generic features found in most websites will also be implemented such as nav-bar, footer, obvious website purpose, etc.

| Feature                   | Feasibility (1-5) | Importance (1-5) |
|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| User Signup               | 4                 | 5                |
| Login and Logout          | 4                 | 5                |
| User Profile Page         | 3                 | 4                |
| User Payment Details      | 3                 | 4                |

| Sort Products             | 3                 | 4                |
| All Products Page         | 4                 | 4                |
| Selected Products on Home | 4                 | 3                |
| Admin - Add Products      | 4                 | 5                |
| Admin - Manage Banners    | 4                 | 4                |

- Importance is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highly important. It assesses how crucial the feature is for the project's success.

This table can help prioritize features for the MVP based on their feasibility and importance.


## Scope
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

>   - Home Page: An engaging home page showcasing the Funkos Galaxy identity, featured products, and a brief description of the store's unique proposition.

>   - Product Page: A page listing the products available for purchase, enabling users to view details, prices, and other vital information.

>   - Contact Page: A contact page where users can send messages or inquiries directly to the Funkos Galaxy team.

By focusing on these core functionalities, we will be able to create a functional initial version of Funkos Galaxy that meets the needs of our users and enables us to gradually expand with more advanced features in the future.






## Design Choices

By making these design choices, Funkos Galaxy will create a visually appealing and user-centric website that caters to the preferences and interests of our target audience.

### Typography
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target
  audience.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

### Images
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

### Design Elements
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you when choosing a framework and goes hand
  in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly
  clever, add a sentence and a screenshot or reference the file the code or css is in.

> - desktop navigation
> - mobile navigation
> - footer
> - containers/cards
> - buttons
> - text input
> - textarea inputs
> - dropdowns

> - audio players

### Animations and Transitions
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've programmed
- special hover state effects

### Frameworks
ðŸš¨**Required**

- If you use bootstrap, tailwind, bulma, materialize or some other JS/CSS framework, call it out here and why you made
  that choice. (Typically I look at the design elements I want and make sure the framework supports them)

### Custom Styles
ðŸš¨**Required**

- call out any overrides you did for bootstrap styles or the framework you used, even if they are fonts and colors,
  perhaps lead assessors to the file of interest in your repo

### Custom Javascript
ðŸš¨**Required**

- call attention to any custom javascript you created to help your User Experience you can organize this by functions or
  files

## Wireframes
ðŸš¨**Required**

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of
the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate
directory), or hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

- You should minimally have wireframes for desktop and mobile for the pages you are making for you register, login,
  read(list/detail), add, update, delete functionality. Adding a Tablet view will help you get into merit and
  distinction.

You can hand draw these, but CI posts a yearly license in the general channel for Balsamiq which is pretty easy to use.
Here is the [2022 announcement](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C0L316Z96/p1640099614368000)


# Information Architecture
As part of the requirements for this project you need to have at **least 3 custom data models**.  It's still under discussion what that means, but I'd make 1 original and then update the products to be custom to what you are selling and create another new one. It's this section that discusses your data and how each piece relates to another and draws out the CRUD functionality you built. You must have CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE for at least one model.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
ðŸš¨**Required**

Wade Williams wrote a great blog about how to add a django extension to auto create an ERD. https://wadewilliams.com/technology-software/generating-erd-for-django-applications/ You can always draw one out by hand or google sheets. You can also draw this up by hand if you want or use a spreadsheet to show your data model.

## Database Choice
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

Just state you used postgres as the database because the data is relational and heroku serves this up realitvely easily with no cost.

## Data Models
ðŸš¨**Required**

# Agile Process

## GitHub User Stories
ðŸš¨**Required**

Now you are ready to start using Git Hub Issues to write your user stories. To get to merit levels you need to show you
have refined stories from Epics to Generic User stories.

### User Story Templates
ðŸš¨**Required**

![Issues1](https://github.com/ocimar84/funkosgalaxy/assets/79640465/e8d0ba26-cac5-4e7d-862a-9323692f0f97)

![Issues2](https://github.com/ocimar84/funkosgalaxy/assets/79640465/187131ed-0504-4d33-9d5c-32d2e9aa1458)


### Product Backlog
ðŸš¨**Required**

https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/085f3a8e344a4cf28b5b5355399abcc1/?child=last
This is the MILESTONE where you grab stories from the issues or USER stories you created and prioritize them and order
them, leave the epics out.

**What to keep in this section**
Include a link to your Product Catalog Milestone,

an initial screenshot, mid-point and final will help document the agile process.

## Iterations
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/71fe6c52cccf477688e924c9889f5fec/?child=first

Add links to iteration milestones (most people have ONE iteration since they are the solo worker, just state that here),
it could be that you won't have all your product backlog worked in the end, and that is ok, hte MVP might morph, you
might find other stories you want instead, it's OK.

## Progress Boards
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

# Testing
ðŸš¨**Required**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that
the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and
ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to
achieve their goals.


**At this point, you should use gitHub Issues Templates and Test Case** to track test cases and defects. Here's
a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit#heading=h.3kdbr3tqbzi)
I put together for this process.

You should make sure your test cases cover the following: 
## Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
ðŸš¨**Required**

To save time, you can create this type of table
in [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

As of Feb 14, 2022 CI students can take advantage of the Student Developer Pack where you have access to great things
like [browserstack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers/#browserstack) You should have received an email about how
to activate your student Developer Pack, here's
a [slack](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C0L316Z96/p1644946870567999) with details if you can't find it
in the associated thread.

Start with a brief explanation of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site
across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints. You can add a column about the spot checking path
you took or write it out here:

1. Visit https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share to figure out the most popular browsers & operating system combos seen across the we for the geographic region, and platoform(s) and screen sizes you expect your users to belong to. 

1. Include a sentence about why you chose the combinations you did.

1. Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

1. if you can't find the brower/device/OS combinations you want on Browserstack with your github student webpack (or you didn't activate that in time), note what you'd ideally test on then what you ended up testing on as a compromise. 

> **Example:**
> To ensure the code was functional and looked good on varoius devices I tested a couple of generic flows though my site on using the following Tool/Device combinations. The device/browser/and OS combinations were used based on reports found at [browser market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) taken on MM/DD/YYYY:
>
> | TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
> |-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
> | real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
> | browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
> | dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
> | browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
> | browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
> | real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
> | browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
> | chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
> | browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
> | real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
> | browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |
>
> Here is a link to the [test case](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/9).

Note, you might find it easier to create a test case for each tool/device and link to the test case in the table here.

## Accessibility Testing
ðŸš¨**Required**

You should have test cases for accessibility and links to them here. Start with a brief paragraph and then link to the
test cases. If you are ambitious you can record the screen of you using the keyboard, convert it to a gif and upload it
to the test case too.

**example**
> To ensure that the site was accessible to people with visual impairments, I used chrome's dev tools, lighthouse audits to ensure I had a score in the green for accessibility and that I could keyboard navigate through the page.
>
> Here are links to the test cases for each which contains the screenshot for the lighthouse audit.
> - [home page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/12)
> - [experience page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/13)
> - [skills page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/14)
> - [recommendations page accessibility test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/15)
>
> To ensure the site was accessibility to people with physical impairments, I tried to navigate the site using tabbed navigation:
> - [site tabbed navigation test](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/10)

You can totally combine the tabbed navigation in the accessibility test and have 2 expected criteria, it's all up to
you!

## Validation Testing
ðŸš¨**Required**

You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation. In this section you should write up any
websites you used to validate your code so there is credit given to those sites. Then add links to the test cases you
put into GitHub for the validation. You can copy your validation success to those tests.

The following site were used to aid in validation testing:

- **[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**

> If you only have one CSS file, you can just run the validator through one deployed page URL, if you have custom CSS for diffent pages, make sure you hit those different URLS

- **[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)**

> For each view you wrote, you should validate the HTML and have a test case for it linked to from here
> NOTE: You may need to right-click to view the source of each page and paste that into the validator if you need to go through authentication to get to the page.

- **[JS validation](https://jshint.com)**

> for each .js file, copy the code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here. You can have warnings, but no errors.
> if using ES6, add this before pasting in your file: `/*jshint esversion: 6 */ `, similarily you can update it to 7 if you see warnings about ES7 syntax `/*jshint esversion: 7 */ `

- **[CI's pep8 tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)** 

> for each .py file you created, copy the source code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here.
> include a screenshot of results in the test case showing NO ERRORS. (you should do this for all .py files in your repo)
> 
> **run.py**
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/212106175-36b2f18a-7c75-458d-94dd-9886e81c71f3.png)

> Ideally you would have no errors remaining outside of line too long which you can fix by 
> 
> adding
> ```$python 
> # noqa
> ```
> There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.
> 
> Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why.

- **[JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/)**

> for each .json file, you should copy the code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here.

## Automated Testing
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

**NOTE: If you want MERIT or Higher, you MUST have some automated testing**
If you managed to write jasmine tests or some django tests, note those files out here and how to run them.

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/documentation/TESTING.md is my write up about my automated testing and how I ran them, but a simple test I'd recommend is a views test that tests authentication and any views you limit to superusers or logged in users.

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/challenges/tests/test_views.py

## Defects
ðŸš¨**Required**

At this point you really should be using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it helps you with the AGILE process
requirement as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them.

[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit#heading=h.542xzc8ufx4x)
I put together on how to do this.

is what my custom tempalte looks like in the UX

Start from installing the chrome extension then clicking the green gitpod button in THEIR FORKED repository, the enumerate the steps to walk them through the process as if they were brand new to this proccess. **Include screenshots** where applicable.

**Key points to cover** 
- Install required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Create env.py
- What to put in the env.py, donâ€™t disclose real values
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEV=True
- Apply Database Migrations so the database starts up `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a super user so you can add and inspect things via django admin  `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Preload data: Sometimes you might want to include steps to create data in the admin or preload a data dump [coderwall blog](https://coderwall.com/p/mvsoyg/django-dumpdata-and-loaddata) has examples on how to dump data and load it which saves a bunch of time when deploying the application from a local database to a hosted database but you donâ€™t  have to do this step
- Start the server `python3 manage.py runserver`


## Production Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a server where anyone can access the url without your machine running. This is typically Heroku. **Include screenshots** if you think they would make the process easier. Start with getting an heroku account and then setting up databases and other packages.

If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values. Do not share your personal
keys but either cut them out of the screenshot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such
values.

**Key points to cover** 
- cerating new app
- setting app name
- setting region
- entering dreaded billing info
- subscribing to a plan
- setting up db
- adding environmental values- have a list or table so user has less chance of typos
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME
>  - SECRET_KEY
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL
>  - COLLECT_STATIC
- adding build packages
- deploy
- gitHub connection
- auto vs manul deploy
- monotior logs
