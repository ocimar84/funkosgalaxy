**Granular Goals Example**
> **Customers**
> Customers of What2do2day are children ages 12-18 who have a bit of freedom to move around unsupervised but a short range of mobility, approximately 5 miles from home.
>
**Customer Goals:**
> - Bring up the site and look for an inexpensive event to attend close to home
> - Look at places to see how they rank without having to read much
> - Quickly find activities that interest them without having to type much
> - Read reviews about places that interest them
> - See events related to places that interest them
> - Easily know where an event they are interested in is located
> - Join an event of interest
> - See how many others are interested in an event
> - Receive notification about an event they've joined
> - Receive updates about events they've joined
>
> **Place Owners**
> Owners of Places would ideally have a different set of user permissions and the Update and Contribute sections of navigation would be under a strict workflow, but in the initial phase, I wanted to show off the ability to add, update and delete items from the website's view,so it's not hidden behind permissions or workflow at this point. Place owners are those that have a business or an organization that hosts free events within a community. Examples are a group that wants to play pickup soccer or a bicycle shop that leads group rides once a month.
>
> **Funko Stores Owner Goals**
>
> - I want my Funko store to be prominently showcased on the website to attract more customers and increase footfall.
> - I want users to share community reviews, so I build trust with future customers
> - I want to manage and update the events hosted by my store, keeping enthusiasts informed about upcoming activities.
> - I want to feature special Funko-related events and promotions associated with my store to engage with collectors.
> - I want to manage and update the events hosted by my store, keeping enthusiasts informed about upcoming activities.

>
> **Website Goals for Funko Stores**
> The primary objective of Funko Stores is to provide a user-friendly platform that seamlessly connects Funko enthusiasts with their favorite stores and collectibles. The website serves as a bridge between collectors, fans, and Funko stores, enhancing the overall experience for all parties involved.

### Typography

Font Types:

# Agile Process

## GitHub User Stories
ðŸš¨**Required**

Now you are ready to start using Git Hub Issues to write your user stories. To get to merit levels you need to show you
have refined stories from Epics to Generic User stories.

### User Story Templates
ðŸš¨**Required**

![Issues1](https://github.com/ocimar84/funkosgalaxy/assets/79640465/e8d0ba26-cac5-4e7d-862a-9323692f0f97)

![Issues2](https://github.com/ocimar84/funkosgalaxy/assets/79640465/187131ed-0504-4d33-9d5c-32d2e9aa1458)


### Product Backlog

## Iterations
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/71fe6c52cccf477688e924c9889f5fec/?child=first

Add links to iteration milestones (most people have ONE iteration since they are the solo worker, just state that here),
it could be that you won't have all your product backlog worked in the end, and that is ok, hte MVP might morph, you
might find other stories you want instead, it's OK.

## Progress Boards

# Testing
ðŸš¨**Required**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that
the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and
ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to
achieve their goals.


**At this point, you should use gitHub Issues Templates and Test Case** to track test cases and defects. Here's
a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit#heading=h.3kdbr3tqbzi)
I put together for this process.

You should make sure your test cases cover the following: 
## Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
ðŸš¨**Required**

To save time, you can create this type of table
in [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

As of Feb 14, 2022 CI students can take advantage of the Student Developer Pack where you have access to great things
like [browserstack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers/#browserstack) You should have received an email about how
to activate your student Developer Pack, here's
a [slack](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C0L316Z96/p1644946870567999) with details if you can't find it
in the associated thread.

Start with a brief explanation of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site
across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints. You can add a column about the spot checking path
you took or write it out here:

1. Visit https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share to figure out the most popular browsers & operating system combos seen across the we for the geographic region, and platoform(s) and screen sizes you expect your users to belong to. 

1. Include a sentence about why you chose the combinations you did.

1. Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

1. if you can't find the brower/device/OS combinations you want on Browserstack with your github student webpack (or you didn't activate that in time), note what you'd ideally test on then what you ended up testing on as a compromise. 

> **Example:**
> To ensure the code was functional and looked good on varoius devices I tested a couple of generic flows though my site on using the following Tool/Device combinations. The device/browser/and OS combinations were used based on reports found at [browser market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) taken on MM/DD/YYYY:
>
> | TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
> |-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
> | real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
> | browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
> | dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
> | browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
> | browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
> | real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
> | browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
> | chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
> | browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
> | real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
> | browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |
>
> Here is a link to the [test case](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ci_mentor_insights/issues/9).

Note, you might find it easier to create a test case for each tool/device and link to the test case in the table here.

## Defects of Note

During the development of **Funko's Galaxy**, we encountered several bugs and issues that required careful attention and resolution. Here are a few notable defects that challenged us:

1. **Shopping Cart Calculation Bug**
